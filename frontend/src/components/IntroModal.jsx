      <div>
        <p>
          KONE operates elevators & escalators that serve over 1 billion people
          worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their elevators are smart - they send data back. KONE's algorithms
          then process the data and provide gazillions of service action
          recommendations for technicians to repair.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is: <b>how to select the useful repair recommendations</b>
          , i.e. the ones that are most likely to require a visit? That's where
          our solution comes in…

      "The Solution",
      <div>
        <ReactTooltip />
        <p>
          We used KONE's dataset of over 100,000 real service action
          recommendations and their outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wrote an ML-model (using <b>catboost</b>, our model is available on{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/ods-pet-projects/Junction2021CreativeNet/tree/master/frontend">
            GitHub

          from past recommendations and provides a score (
          <b>POSITIVE FEEDBACK</b>) for how likely a given recommendation is to
          be useful.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>We tested our model on test data, achieving 97.7% accuracy!</p>
        <p>And then we mapped the data!</p>

      "How Our Demo Works?",
      <div>
        <p>
          This page serves to demonstrate our solution. It has the following:

          <li style={{ listStyleType: "none!important" }}>
            ⚬ <b>map-based repsentation of recommendation assessments</b> - we
            have plotted an example map of one city (Tokyo) with incoming sensor
            calls over the period of two days with recommendations assessed by
            our algorithm. This could be extended to any city where KONE
            operates, providing an easy tool for grouping and navigating the
            estimations.

          <li style={{ listStyleType: "none!important" }}>
            ⚬ <b>table-based representation of recommendation assessments</b> -
            we provide a table with recommendations assessed (see the POSITIVE
            FEEDBACK field). Technicians can navigate this table, review repair
            tasks, and accept or discard them based on our recommendations.

              individually
            </b>{" "}
            - you can click "Get details" on any of the table rows and reach a
            page with a more detailed explanation of how our assessment was
            reached.

        </ul>
        <p>
          We hope this can make repairs much more efficient, saving resources
          and increasing the safety and well-being of a subset of the 1 billion
          people using KONE elevators!
